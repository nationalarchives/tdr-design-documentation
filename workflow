# Workflow

Once:

    Init the git repo  
    Add all the sketch files you are working on the repo  

Then:

    Create a new branch when you start working on a new feature  
    Work normally on your design  
    Save the file  
    Commit the changes with a meaningful message describing them. The plugin will extract the artboards in your file in order to show the differences easily.  
    Push your changes to the remote  
    Create a pull request from your branch to the master branch  
    Voila. Your co-workers can review the changes, comment on them and approve them. Once approved, merge the pull request.
